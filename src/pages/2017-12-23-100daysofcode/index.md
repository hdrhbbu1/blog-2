**Today I want to write to you about some very interesting idea - coding challenge!**

Recently while browsing a twitter I found a `#100DaysOfCode` hashtag. Then I came to challenge
[website](http://100daysofcode.com/). So I decided to give it a try!

## What is 100 Days of Code

This is a coding challenge when you commit yourself to coding everyday at least 1h and document that.
The whole action take place on twitter where you can track your progress posting quick info about
what you did today.

## Why I choose that challenge

I like idea of having small steps consistently through large time span. I'd rather spent 30min everyday
instead of spending 2,5h once in a week. 100 Days of Code is a good example of this approach. I also
really like idea of support that is comming from community (either via twitter or slack). I gives me
a power to go through everyday and code this 1h.

## What I want to accomplish

I decided to make yourself better in at least two areas: CSS and algorithms. Why? I want to get more
into front-end work so I cannot escape from CSS here. Algorithms - I always struggle with that as I
didn't have CS diploma.

Let's see how this will go - I will write blog post summing up whole action.
